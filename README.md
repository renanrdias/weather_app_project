# weather_app_project

## The Main Goal

In this project, the main goal is to understand how Flutter handles API communication. In order to do so, we're going to use the [openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Another important topic we're going to cover is the asynchronous programming in Dart.

## The App

The app allows us to insert a location we want to get the weather data, as well as get the user's current location and show the current weather condition.

## Learning Topics

* Asynchronous programming.
* Key words 'async' and 'await'.
* Concept of Futures in Dart.
* Networking by using the package http
* Handle json data and parse them by using the convert package
* Pass data forwards and backwards by using Navigator
* Handle exceptions by using try/catch/throw
* Learn about Stateful Widgets lifecycle
* Use the geolocator package 
* Use the TextField Widget to get user's input
